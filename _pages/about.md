We are a team of researchers and instructors committed to advancing AI and data science for Ethiopian languages and industry-specific challenges. Our focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Science aims to enhance accessibility and innovation through localized solutions. This initiative is inspired by [Dr. Seid Muhie Yimam](https://seyyaw.github.io/) from the University of Hamburg and supported by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

## Our Mission

Adapt global advancements in AI to Ethiopian language needs and industry challenges, leveraging NLP and Data Science for accessible and innovative solutions.
