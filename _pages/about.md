We are a team of passionate researchers, instructors, and collaborators committed to adapting global advancements in AI and data science to Ethiopian languages and task-specific challenges across industries. By focusing on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Science, our work aims to enhance accessibility, drive innovation, and empower communities through localized technological solutions. This initiative inspired by [Dr. Seid Muhie Yimam](https://seyyaw.github.io/) from the University of Hamburg and supported by the [International Organization for Migration (IOM)](https://www.iom.int/).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
